Raul is the Chef @ #Coderbunker. He's fantastic at feeding crowds of hungry code geeks and, when not busy in the kitchen, manages
the network here at the bunker. pfSense is the tool of choice for that. Let's see what R.R. has on the menu for us.

Intro: (thanks @wikipedia) pfSense (https://www.pfsense.org/) is an open source firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD.
It is installed on a physical computer or a virtual machine to creat a dedicated firewall/router for a network and has been noted for its reliability and feature richness. pfSense can be configured and upgraded through a web-based interface, and requires no knowledge of the underlying FreeBSD system to manage.
It is commonly deployed as a perimeter firewall, router, wireless access point, DHCP server, DNS server, and as a VPN endpoint.
pfSense supports installation of many third-party packages (like Snort or Squid) through its (GUI) Package Manager.
As of 2016 pfSense is described by servethehome.com as the "gold standard" for open source network appliances in its buyer guides.
