### Build an IoT App testing infrasturcture with virtual Raspberry Pi's

Coderbunker is glad to welcome back Prof. LU for another workshop in our loose Raspberry Pi/IoT series.

This session is for those serious about mastering Linux, interested in IoT, cloud computing, and the Raspberry PI.

In this hands-on co-hacking workshop, we will attempt to build a Raspberry PI ("RPI") virtual machine by compiling Linux code. We then will launch big numbers of virtual RPIs 'in the cloud' in order to simulate massive IoT application testing.

Once the session is complete, participants will have learnt to:
- compile Linux code to build a custom variant of Linux
- prepare a virtual RPI
- make use of the cloud to launch massive virtual "IoT" devices 

After that, only your imagination will limit what you can produce with this knowledge in hand.
