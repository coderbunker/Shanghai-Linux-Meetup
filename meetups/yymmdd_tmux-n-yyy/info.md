   _"tmux is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session.
It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command-line interface, and for separating programs from the Unix shell that started the program.
It provides much of the same functionality as GNU Screen, but it is distributed under a BSD license."_
