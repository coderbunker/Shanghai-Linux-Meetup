- The [**Shanghai Linux & Open Source Meetup**](https://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Linux-Meetup) is planned to be held weekly at Shanghai's one and only [**#Coderbunker**](https://coderbunker.com/about) as a series of Workshop-style events.
- We will have an introduction or talk to the topic of the week plus hopefully a vibrant `do-it-yourself` kind of hands on workshop where the projects or matters presented can be applied practically (on a virtual machine or a cloud server). The character of the talks will most likely be pretty casual and not all too fancy.
- The **schedule** can be found [here](https://github.com/vrms/Shanghai-Linux-Meetup/blob/master/topics_and_schedule.md)

For the time being we will charge CNï¿¥50.- including a drink from the richly stacked #Coderbunker's Fridge to cover some basic costs emerging in order to make this happening.
